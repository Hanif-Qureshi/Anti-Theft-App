# 🔐 Anti-Theft Android App

A professionally designed **Anti-Theft Android application** built in **Kotlin + XML**.  
This app detects theft-related actions like charger unplugging, pocket removal, or sudden motion and triggers a loud siren to alert the user — even if the app is closed or the device reboots.
